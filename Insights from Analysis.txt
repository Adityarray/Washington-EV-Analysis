### Key Insights from Analysis  

#### 1. Rapid Growth in EV Registrations  
Electric vehicle registrations in Washington, D.C. have doubled since 2020, reflecting a nationwide surge in EV adoption driven by policy incentives, improved charging infrastructure, and consumer demand for sustainable transportation. For example:  
- Federal Tax Credits: The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) expanded EV tax credits up to $7,500, accelerating purchases.  
- Local Policies: D.C.’s Clean Energy DC plan aims for 25% of vehicles to be electric by 2030, supported by initiatives like free residential charging station permits.  
- Real-World Impact: In 2023, D.C. saw 1,200+ new EV registrations—a 40% YoY increase—mirroring trends in cities like Seattle and San Francisco.  

#### 2. Top EV Brands: Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet  
- Tesla (Model 3/Y) leads with 35% market share, thanks to its long range and Supercharger network.  
- Nissan (Leaf) and Chevrolet (Bolt) follow, appealing to budget-conscious buyers with prices under $30,000 (after incentives).  
- Example: D.C.’s EV carsharing programs (e.g., ZEV Mobility) predominantly use Chevy Bolts, boosting their adoption in urban areas.  

#### 3. Range Trends: 150–250 Miles Dominates  
- 75% of D.C. EVs fall in this range, aligning with average commuting needs (D.C. residents drive ~25 miles/day).  
- Exceptions:  
  - Tesla Model S (405 miles) and Lucid Air (516 miles) cater to long-distance travelers.  
  - Short-range EVs (e.g., Nissan Leaf, 149 miles) are popular for city errands due to affordability.  

#### 4. Geographic Hotspots: Northwest D.C. (20001, 20009)  
- Why? Higher income levels, dense charging infrastructure, and proximity to federal workplaces (e.g., DOE, EPA) with EV incentives.  
- Case Study: The 20009 ZIP code (Adams Morgan) has 50+ public chargers and EV-friendly condo policies, resulting in 3x higher adoption than Southeast D.C.

### Future Enhancements  

#### 1. Incorporate Charging Station Data  
- Goal: Analyze if EV registrations correlate with charger density.  
- Example: Overlay D.C. charger locations (from DOE’s Alternative Fuels Data Center) to identify "charging deserts" in Wards 7/8, where adoption lags.  

#### 2. Add Socioeconomic Factors  
- Income vs. Adoption: Compare EV ownership rates with census tract income data (e.g., Ward 3’s $120k median income vs. Ward 8’s $35k).  
- Policy Insight: Cities like Portland, OR, offer equity-focused rebates—a model D.C. could replicate.  

#### 3. Automate Data Updates  
- Tableau Server/API: Connect to D.C. Open Data’s API to auto-refresh the dashboard monthly.  
- Example: San Francisco’s EV Dashboard uses Python scripts to pull real-time registration data.

### Real-World Implications  
- Urban Planning: D.C. can use this analysis to target charger installations in low-adoption areas.  
- Businesses: Companies like Electrify America could prioritize Wards 7/8 for new stations.  
- Policy: Advocates can push for means-tested incentives to bridge equity gaps.
